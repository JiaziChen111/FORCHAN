# FORCHAN

I used Fortran back in undergraduate and wanted to brush up on it during graduate school. 

The simple codes section of this repo contains basic practice exercises from the book Fortran 90 programming by Ellis, Philips, and Lahey. 

The quantecon section will eventually contain a few simple exercises from quantecon done in Fortran.
